    <body>Hello guys today we will differentitate beetwen GOOGLE LENS AND MOBILENET MODEL.
        So,there are many case study on both of these to find that which model can find 
        objects more accurately.You all will guess GOOGLE LENS and yes it is the winner.
        GOOGLE LENS see the object as the human eye see and the MOBILENET model see as a 
        shape like any Geometric shape.Hence,it is based on my thinking so don't tell me
        that you are saying wrong things.You can see the case study on google beetwen
        GOOGLE LENS AND MOBILENET.

        Here are some of the licks to see the case study
